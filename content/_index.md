### Thesis work
Image trying to understand the flow of city traffic with little understanding of how cars, traffic signs or signals work. Why do some cars stop while others continue? Why do some blatantly ignore rules others appear to follow? Now imaging untangling this while the city is covered in a dense fog (similar to the opacity of tissue). That is what it is like to study cell-cell coordination. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cell coordination is at the center of immune response, cancer metastasis, fetal development, and wound healing. Yet how individual cells communicate and coordinate their behaviors on scales hundreds of times larger than themselves is not well understood. My thesis works to understand coordination on the individual cell level by combining computer science and statistics with biological experiments to generate data driven models for testing hypothesis.
