      <description>Some simple definitions to work from:
 There is some (probably unknown, but sampleable) distribution \(p_{data}\) We have paired real samples \([(x_1,g_1), ..., (x_N,g_N)]\). Where \(x_i\) is a sample from \(x_i \sim P(X|G = g_i)\) and \(g\) is the group \(x_i\) should be classified in (\(g \in G, G = (g^k,...,K)\)). Note that K is typically much less than N. X and G are not independent (\(P(X|G) \not= P(X)P(G)\)), as there would be no structure to use to classify.</description>
